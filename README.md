# Like It or Or Not

Simple app to let User save and retrieve their experience.
## [Try it](https://ka-mk-lion.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation
How often you ware staring on the menu in the restaurant trying to remember the item you enjoyed last time or looking at the shelf at the wine store with "What was that great wine I've tried in Donovan's?" in your head?
